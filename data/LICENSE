DRAG COEFFICIENT DATA PROVENANCE AND LICENSE

The drag coefficient tables (g1.csv, g7.csv, g1.npy, g7.npy) contain data 
originally measured by:
- US Army Ballistic Research Laboratory
- Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland
- Published via Winchester-Western Division, Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation, 1965
- Refined through work of Robert L. McCoy and others at BRL

STATUS: PUBLIC DOMAIN

As work of the US Government, these measurements are in the public domain.
No copyright or license restrictions apply to the drag coefficient values themselves.

The data represents physical measurements of drag forces on standard reference 
projectiles and are scientific facts not subject to copyright protection.

DATA DESCRIPTION:
- G1: Standard projectile with 2 caliber radius ogival-head, flat base
- G7: Standard projectile with 7 caliber radius ogival-head, boat tail base
- Format: Mach number, drag coefficient (Cd)
- Atmosphere: ICAO Standard Atmosphere

FORMAT AND ARRANGEMENT:
While the drag coefficient values are public domain, any specific formatting,
arrangement, or software implementation may have separate licensing. The CSV and
NPY file formats used here are provided without restriction.

HISTORICAL NOTE:
These drag functions have been the industry standard for external ballistics
calculations since 1965. They are used universally in ballistics software,
firing tables, and trajectory calculations worldwide.
